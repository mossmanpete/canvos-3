# Canvos v3
Reconstructed from the ground up to be better
Built on ~~Processing 3~~ C++, Node.js, and a various array of other things, perhaps eventually including linux

## Currently updating files, do not clone

## New Features (as opposed to old(er) CanvOS versions)
- Client now runs in app as opposed to web browser (faster, ~~better performance~~ faster)
- ~~Can utilize storage both on host and client devices, like two drives~~ (actually this is false Arsentical)
- Upgraded terminal
- New UI that looks ~~good~~ ok actually
- ~~You now have the power to do application things~~ (wtf Arsentical you can run applications duh)
- Multiple people can access and use the same desktop at once in real-time: like using a remote desktop to control someone else's computer, except there's multiple cursors instead of just one
- Client support for almost any OS (includes Windows, Linux, and OS X, both in x86 and ARM versions. will be on RISC-V, not in near future.), Server support for Linux only because filesystem jank
- ISO bootable version that runs on top of linux (when i figure out how to linux)

## actual things it has
- Server stores data, clients connect in sessions (kinda like old x-servers)
- But you can have multiple people "share" a session (kinda like google docs sharing)
- There will be a UI
- Client runs on a bunch of stuff
  - Linux
  - Mac
  - Windows
  - RISC-V eventually
- The server will eventually be packaged into a minimal Ubuntu ISO
